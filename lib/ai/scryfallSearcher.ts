Display Keywords

Colors and Color Identity

You can find cards that are a certain color using the c: or color: keyword, and cards that are a certain color identity using the id: or identity: keywords.

Both sets of keywords accepts full color names like blue or the abbreviated color letters w, u, r, b and g.

You can use many nicknames for color sets: all guild names (e.g. azorius), all shard names (e.g. bant), all college names (e.g., quandrix), all wedge names (e.g. abzan), and the four-color nicknames chaos, aggression, altruism, growth, artifice are supported.

Use c or colorless to match colorless cards, and m or multicolor to match multicolor cards.

You can use comparison expressions (>, <, >=, <=, and !=) to check against ranges of colors.

Find cards that have a color indicator with has:indicator.

c:rg Cards that are red and green

color>=uw -c:red Cards that are at least white and blue, but not red

id<=esper t:instant Instants you can play with an Esper commander

id:c t:land Land cards with colorless identity

Card Types

Find cards of a certain card type with the t: or type: keywords. You can search for any supertype, card type, or subtype.

Using only partial words is allowed.

t:merfolk t:legend Legendary merfolk cards

t:goblin -t:creature Goblin cards that aren’t creatures

Card Text

Use the o: or oracle: keywords to find cards that have specific phrases in their text box.

You can put quotes " " around text with punctuation or spaces.

You can use ~ in your text as a placeholder for the card’s name.

This keyword usually checks the current Oracle text for cards, so it uses the most up-to-date phrasing available. For example, “dies” instead of “is put into a graveyard”.

Use the fo: or fulloracle: operator to search the full Oracle text, which includes reminder text.

You can also use keyword: or kw: to search for cards with a specific keyword ability.

o:draw t:creature Creatures that deal with drawing cards

o:"~ enters tapped" Cards that enter the battlefield tapped

kw:flying -t:creature Noncreatures that have the flying keyword

Mana Costs

Use the m: or mana: keyword to search for cards that have certain symbols in their mana costs.

This keyword uses the official text version of mana costs set forth in the Comprehensive Rules. For example, {G} represents a green mana.

Shorthand is allowed for symbols that aren’t split: G is the same as {G}

However, you must always wrap complex/split symbols like {2/G} in braces.

You can search for mana costs using comparison operators; a mana cost is greater than another if it includes all the same symbols and more, and it’s less if it includes only a subset of symbols.

You can find cards of a specific mana value with manavalue or mv, comparing with a numeric expression (>, <, =, >=, <=, and !=). You can also find even or odd mana costs with manavalue:even or manavalue:odd

You can filter cards that contain hybrid mana symbols with is:hybrid or Phyrexian mana symbols with is:phyrexian

You can find permanents that provide specific levels of devotion, using either single-color mana symbols for devotion to one color, or hybrid symbols for devotion to two, with devotion: or a comparison operator.

You can also find cards that produce specific types of mana, with produces:

mana:{G}{U} Cards with one green and blue mana in their costs

m:2WW Cards with two generic and two white mana in their cost

m>3WU Cards that cost more than three generic, one white, and one blue mana

m:{R/P} Cards with one Phyrexian red mana in their cost

c:u mv=5 Blue cards with mana value 5

devotion:{u/b}{u/b}{u/b} Cards that contribute 3 to devotion to black and blue

produces=wu Cards that produce blue and white mana

Power, Toughness, and Loyalty

You can use numeric expressions (>, <, =, >=, <=, and !=) to find cards with certain power, power/pow, toughness, toughness/tou, total power and toughness, pt/powtou, or starting loyalty, loyalty/loy.

You can compare the values with each other or with a provided number.

pow>=8 Cards with 8 or more power

pow>tou c:w t:creature White creatures that are top-heavy

t:planeswalker loy=3 Planeswalkers that start at 3 loyalty

Multi-faced Cards

You can find cards that have more than one face with is:split (split cards), is:flip (flip cards), is:transform (cards that transform), is:meld (cards that meld), is:leveler (cards with Level Up), is:dfc (double-faced cards), and is:mdfc (modal double-faced cards).

is:meld Cards that meld

is:split Split-faced cards

Spells, Permanents, and Effects

Find cards that are cast as spells with is:spell.

Find permanent cards with is:permanent, historic cards with is:historic, creatures that can be in your party with is:party, modal effects with is:modal, vanilla creatures with is:vanilla, or French vanilla cards with is:frenchvanilla. Find 2/2/2 “bear” creatures with is:bear.

c>=br is:spell f:duel Black and red multicolor spells in Duel Commander

is:permanent t:rebel Rebel permanents

is:vanilla Vanilla creatures

Extra Cards and Funny Cards

Vanguard, plane, scheme, and phenomenon cards are hidden by default, as are cards from “memorabilia” sets. You must either search for their type (using the type: keyword) or a set that contains them (the set: keyword).

Un-cards, holiday cards, and other funny cards are findable with is:funny or mentioning their set.

You may also use include:extras to reveal absolutely every card when you search.

is:funny All funny cards

t:scheme Scheme cards

power include:extras Cards with “power” in their name, including extras

Rarity

Use r: or rarity: to find cards by their print rarity. You can search for common, uncommon, rare, ‘special’, mythic, and ‘bonus’. You can also use comparison operators like < and >=.

Use new:rarity to find reprint cards printed at a new rarity for the first time. You can find cards that have ever been printed in a given rarity using in: (for example, in:rare to find cards that have ever been printed at rare.)

r:common t:artifact Common artifacts

r>=r Cards at rare rarity or above (i.e., rares and mythics)

rarity:common e:ima new:rarity Cards printed as commons for the first time in Iconic Masters

in:rare -rarity:rare Non-rare printings of cards that have been printed at rare

Sets and Blocks

Use s:, e:, set:, or edition: to find cards using their Magic set code.

Use cn: or number: to find cards by collector number within a set. Combine this with s: to find specific card editions. Searching by ranges with a syntax like cn>50 is also possible.

Use b: or block: to find cards in a Magic block by providing the three-letter code for any set in that block.

The in: keyword finds cards that once “passed through” the given set code. For example in:lea would only match cards that once appeared in Alpha.

You can search for cards based on the type of product they appear in. This includes the primary product types (st:core, st:expansion, or st:draftinnovation), as well as series of products (st:masters, st:funny, st:commander, st:duel_deck, st:from_the_vault, st:spellbook, or st:premium_deck) and more specialized types (st:alchemy, st:archenemy, st:masterpiece, st:memorabilia, st:planechase, st:promo, st:starter, st:token, st:treasure_chest, or st:vanguard.)

The in: keyword also supports these set types, so you can search for cards with no printings in a set type with a query like -in:core.

You can also search for individual cards that were sold in certain places with is:booster or is:planeswalker_deck, or specific types of promo cards with is: queries like is:league, is:buyabox, is:giftbox, is:intro_pack, is:gameday, is:prerelease, is:release, is:fnm, is:judge_gift, is:arena_league, is:player_rewards, is:media_insert, is:instore, is:convention, or is:set_promo, among others.

Data for these two features comes from the Tagger project.

is:dual Cards that are dual lands

is:fetchland Cards that are fetchlands

is:colorshifted Colorshifted cards

Negating Conditions

All keywords except for include can be negated by prefixing them with a hyphen (-). This inverts the meaning of the keyword to reject cards that matched what you’ve searched for.

The is: keyword has a convenient inverted mode not: which is the same as -is:. Conversely, -not: is the same as is:.

Loose name words can also be inverted with -

-fire c:r t:instant Red instants without the word “fire” in their name

o:changeling -t:creature Changeling cards that aren’t creatures

not:reprint e:c16 Cards in Commander 2016 that aren’t reprints

Regular Expressions

You can use forward slashes // instead of quotes with the type:, t:, oracle:, o:, flavor:, ft:, and name: keywords to match those parts of a card with a regular expression.

Scryfall supports many regex features such as .*?, option groups (a|b), brackets [ab], character classes \d, \w, and anchors (?!), \b, ^, and $.

Forward slashes inside your regex must be escaped with \/.

Full documentation for this keyword is available on our Regular Expressions help page.

t:creature o:/^{T}:/ Creatures that tap with no other payment

t:instant o:/\spp/ Instants that provide +X/+X effects

name:/\bizzet\b/ Card names with “izzet” but not words like “mizzet”

Exact Names

If you prefix words or quoted phrases with ! you will find cards with that exact name only.

This is still case-insensitive.

!fire The card Fire

!"sift through sands" The card Sift Through Sands

Using “OR”

By default every search term you enter is combined. All of them must match to find a card.

If you want to search over a set of options or choices, you can put the special word or/OR between terms.

t:fish or t:bird Cards that are Fish or Birds

t:land (a:titus or a:avon) Lands illustrated by Titus Lunter or John Avon

Nesting Conditions

You may nest conditions inside parentheses ( ) to group them together. This is most useful when combined with the OR keyword.

Remember that terms that are not separated by OR are still combined.

t:legendary (t:goblin or t:elf) Legendary goblins or elves

through (depths or sands or mists) The Unspeakable combo

Display Keywords

You can enter your display options for searches as keywords rather than using the controls on the page.

Select how duplicate results are eliminated with unique:cards, unique:prints (previously ++), or unique:art (also @@).

Change how results are shown with display:grid, display:checklist, display:full, or display:text.

Change how results are sorted with order:artist, order:cmc, order:power, order:toughness, order:set, order:name, order:usd, order:tix, order:eur, order:rarity, order:color, order:released, order:spoiled, order:edhrec, order:penny, or order:review.

Select what printings of cards to preferentially show with prefer:oldest, prefer:newest, prefer:usd-low or prefer:usd-high (and the equivalents for tix and eur), or prefer:promo.

Change the order of the sorted data with direction:asc or direction:desc.

!"Lightning Bolt" unique:prints Every printing of Lightning Bolt

f:modern order:rarity direction:asc Modern legal cards sorted by rarity, commons first
